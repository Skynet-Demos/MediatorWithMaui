# MAUI with MediatR
It is quite common in application development that two components need to communicate with each other
We can achieve that without any dependency (de-coupling) on each other using MediatR library
This can be implemented in any .Net application. Today, we're going to explore how it works in .Net MAUI.

Iâ€™m assuming that you have already watched my previous tutorial on <a href="https://youtu.be/r3HLFO2Yz1g">.Net Maui Storage Options | Preferences | Secure Storage | File System | Sqlite</a>.<br/>
If not, I strongly recommend you watch that and come back here<br/>
